# AWS Shared Responsibility Model

The AWS Shared Responsibility Model is a security model that outlines the division of responsibilities between AWS and its customers when it comes to securing the cloud environment. The model clarifies which security measures are the responsibility of AWS, and which measures are the responsibility of the customer.

In general, AWS is responsible for the security of the cloud infrastructure and the underlying hardware, while customers are responsible for the security of their applications and data that are deployed on the cloud infrastructure.

Specifically, the shared responsibility model can be broken down as follows:

- AWS is responsible for the security of the cloud infrastructure, which includes the physical facilities, networking, and virtualization layer.
- Customers are responsible for securing the applications and data that they deploy on the cloud infrastructure, including their operating systems, applications, and the data stored within them.
- The responsibility for securing certain services and components may be shared between AWS and the customer, depending on the specific service and deployment model.

It's important to note that while AWS takes responsibility for certain aspects of security, such as the physical security of their data centers and the underlying hardware, customers are still ultimately responsible for ensuring the security of their own applications and data.

## What are the elements of the Shared Responsibility Model?

The AWS Shared Responsibility Model outlines the division of responsibilities between AWS and its customers when it comes to securing the cloud environment. The model can be broken down into two main elements:

1. **AWS Responsibility**: AWS is responsible for securing the infrastructure that runs all of the services offered in the AWS Cloud. This includes:

- Physical security of data centers, regions, and availability zones
- Network security, such as segmentation, isolation, and denial of unauthorized access
- Computing infrastructure, including EC2 instances, databases, and other AWS services
- Storage infrastructure, including EBS, S3, and Glacier
- Managed services, such as RDS, DynamoDB, and others
- Foundational services, such as IAM, CloudTrail, and others

2. **Customer Responsibility**: Customers are responsible for securing the applications and data that they deploy on the cloud infrastructure. This includes:

- Securing the guest operating system (OS) of their EC2 instances, including patching and updating security configurations
- Securing applications and data within their instances
- Configuring their own network security, such as firewalls and access controls
- Managing and securing the credentials and permissions used to access AWS services and resources
- Encrypting data in transit and at rest
- Defining and enforcing access policies and controls
- Performing compliance and security monitoring and analysis

It's important to note that the division of responsibilities can vary depending on the specific service and deployment model used. AWS provides guidance and documentation to help customers understand their responsibilities in each case.

## How would a customer's responsbility on AWS shift depending on service (i.e. RDS, Lambda or EC2)?

The customer's responsibilities in the AWS Shared Responsibility Model can vary depending on the service used. Here are some examples of how responsibilities may shift:

- **RDS**: With Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service), AWS manages the underlying infrastructure for the database instance, including patching, backups, and multi-AZ replication. However, customers are responsible for configuring the database instance, including security groups, user access control, database encryption, and application-level security.

- **Lambda**: With AWS Lambda, customers are responsible for the code and data used by their Lambda functions, including the security and access controls for the code and data. AWS manages the underlying compute infrastructure, including scaling, patching, and security updates.

- **EC2**: With Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud), customers have more responsibilities compared to managed services like RDS and Lambda. Customers are responsible for managing the operating system and applications running on the instance, including security patches and updates. Additionally, customers are responsible for managing the network and firewall configuration, including security groups, network access control lists (ACLs), and virtual private cloud (VPC) configurations.

Overall, the specific responsibilities of customers and AWS can vary depending on the service and deployment model used. AWS provides detailed documentation and guidance to help customers understand their responsibilities in each case. It's important for customers to understand their specific responsibilities so they can ensure that their applications and data are secure and compliant in the cloud.
