# Resources for Security Support

## AWS Native Products

AWS provides a variety of network security capabilities to help customers secure their infrastructure and data. Some of these capabilities include:

- **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**: This is a private, isolated section of the AWS cloud where customers can launch their resources in a logically isolated network. Customers can control traffic to and from their resources in the VPC using security groups and network access control lists (ACLs).

- **Security Groups**: These are stateful firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic to and from Amazon EC2 instances, and can be used to restrict access to other AWS resources as well.

- **Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)**: These are stateless firewalls that control traffic to and from subnets in a VPC.

- **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: This is a service that provides firewall protection for web applications running on Amazon CloudFront and Amazon API Gateway.

- **AWS Shield**: This is a managed DDoS protection service that safeguards web applications running on AWS.

- **AWS PrivateLink**: This is a service that provides private connectivity between VPCs, AWS services, and on-premises applications over the AWS network.

- **AWS Direct Connect**: This is a network service that provides dedicated, private connectivity between on-premises data centers and AWS.

- **VPN and AWS Client VPN**: These are services that provide secure, encrypted connectivity between on-premises networks and AWS.

- **AWS Transit Gateway**: This is a service that simplifies network architecture by connecting VPCs and on-premises networks through a central hub.

These network security capabilities can be combined and configured to meet a wide range of security requirements for different types of workloads on AWS.

## 3rd Party Products on Amazon Marketplace

AWS Marketplace is a digital catalog of software solutions from third-party vendors that can be deployed directly to the AWS Cloud. It provides a range of security products from third-party vendors that can be used to augment the built-in security capabilities of AWS. These products include:

- **Firewall and Security Group Management**: These products help secure the network layer of an AWS deployment by providing enhanced firewall functionality and more granular control over security groups.

- **Vulnerability Management**: These products help identify and manage vulnerabilities in your AWS environment, allowing you to patch and remediate issues more effectively.

- **Threat Detection and Response**: These products help detect and respond to security threats in real-time, providing enhanced visibility and incident response capabilities.

- **Compliance and Governance**: These products help maintain compliance with various regulatory requirements and industry standards, providing tools for audit logging, security assessments, and policy enforcement.

Overall, the AWS Marketplace provides customers with a range of third-party security products that can be integrated with AWS services to improve the security posture of their deployments.

## Where can someone find documentation for security support?

You can find AWS documentation for security support on the **AWS Security Hub** website (https://aws.amazon.com/security/) and in the **AWS documentation pages** (https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/). 

The AWS Security Hub website provides access to AWS security best practices, whitepapers, and official documentation on security and compliance topics. Additionally, you can find information on the AWS Marketplace for third-party security products and services that can enhance your AWS security posture. 

AWS also provides support for security-related issues through their support channels, including AWS Support, AWS Trusted Advisor, and AWS Security Response.

The **AWS Knowledge Center** is a resource that provides customers with answers to frequently asked questions, best practices, and troubleshooting tips. It includes a collection of articles, videos, and other resources that cover a wide range of AWS topics, including security.

The **AWS Security Center** is a central location where customers can access AWS security-related information, tools, and services. It provides guidance on how to use AWS services securely and helps customers meet compliance requirements. It includes a variety of resources, such as security whitepapers, security bulletins, security best practices, and compliance documentation. The Security Center also provides access to security-related services, such as AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), AWS Key Management Service (KMS), and AWS CloudTrail.

## What is AWS Trusted Advisor and how do they perform security checks?

AWS Trusted Advisor is a tool that provides guidance to help customers optimize their AWS infrastructure, improve performance and security, and reduce costs. The tool uses a set of best practices to analyze customers' AWS accounts and makes recommendations in five categories: Cost Optimization, Performance, Security, Fault Tolerance, and Service Limits.

In terms of security, AWS Trusted Advisor provides security checks and recommendations to help customers improve the security of their AWS environment. Some examples of security checks include:

- **IAM Use**: Checks for the use of IAM best practices, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) and password policies.
- **Security Groups - Specific Ports Unrestricted**: Checks for security groups that allow unrestricted access to specific ports.
- **S3 Bucket Permissions**: Checks for S3 buckets with public permissions.
- **RDS Security Group Access Risk**: Checks for RDS instances with public access or unrestricted access.

Overall, AWS Trusted Advisor can help customers improve the security of their AWS infrastructure by identifying potential security issues and making recommendations for remediation.
