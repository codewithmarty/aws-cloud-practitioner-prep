# AWS Global Infrastructure

## How is AWS globally structured?

AWS is globally structured into Regions, Availability Zones (AZ) and Edge Locations.

## How are Regions, AZs and Edge Locations related?

In the AWS global infrastructure, a Region is a physical location around the world where AWS has multiple data centers. Each Region is designed to be completely independent and isolated from other Regions. AWS currently has 25 Regions globally.

Within each Region, there are multiple Availability Zones (AZs). An Availability Zone is a distinct location within a Region that is engineered to be isolated from failures in other Availability Zones and provides redundant power, networking, and connectivity. AWS recommends that customers architect their applications to use multiple Availability Zones in a Region to achieve high availability and fault tolerance.

Edge Locations are endpoints for AWS services located in different parts of the world, which are used for content caching and delivery. They are used by AWS CloudFront, Amazon Route 53, and AWS Global Accelerator to reduce the latency experienced by customers accessing these services from different regions. Edge Locations are separate from Regions and Availability Zones and are spread across the globe to bring the services closer to the end-users.

In summary, Regions are physical locations that house multiple Availability Zones. Availability Zones are isolated locations within a Region that offer redundancy and high availability, while Edge Locations are endpoints used to accelerate content delivery.

## How does one achieve high availability through the use of multiple AZs?

To achieve high availability, it is recommended to deploy resources across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) within a region. 

An Availability Zone is a separate data center facility, located in the same region, that has independent power, cooling, and networking. These AZs are connected with high-speed, private links, which provide reliable, low-latency communication between them.

To use multiple Availability Zones for high availability, you can deploy your application or service across multiple AZs and configure load balancing to route traffic to those AZs. 

If one AZ goes down or experiences an outage, the load balancer will route traffic to the healthy AZs. This can provide redundancy and help ensure that your application or service remains available even in the event of a failure.

For example, if you are running a web application in AWS, you could deploy your web servers in multiple AZs, with a load balancer distributing traffic between them. If one AZ experiences an outage, the load balancer will automatically redirect traffic to the healthy AZs, preventing any downtime or disruption to the application.

Availability Zones (AZs) are designed to be isolated from each other and have their own independent power and network connectivity, so that failure in one Availability Zone doesn't affect the others. This design is intended to provide high availability and fault tolerance for applications running on AWS. Therefore, AZs do not share single points of failure.

## When should you use multiple AWS regions?

You should use multiple AWS regions when you need to provide low latency and high availability to users in different geographic locations, or when you need to comply with regulatory requirements that mandate data replication and disaster recovery across multiple regions. 

By replicating data and applications across multiple regions, you can minimize the impact of service disruptions caused by regional events such as natural disasters, power outages, and network failures.

For example, if you have customers in both the United States and Europe, you might deploy your application in the US East (N. Virginia) and EU (Ireland) regions to ensure low latency and high availability. 

Similarly, if you need to comply with data sovereignty regulations, you might deploy your application in multiple regions within a country or region to ensure that data is stored and processed locally. 

However, deploying your application in multiple regions may also increase complexity and cost, so you should carefully evaluate the trade-offs and design your application architecture accordingly.

## What exactly is data sovereignty?

Data sovereignty refers to the concept that data is subject to the laws and regulations of the country or region in which it is located. In the context of cloud computing, data sovereignty can become an issue when a company stores its data in a cloud service provider's data center located in a different country or region than where the company operates. This can lead to potential legal and regulatory challenges around data privacy, data protection, and data access.

By using multiple AWS regions, companies can ensure that their data is stored and processed in compliance with local laws and regulations, as well as address concerns related to data sovereignty. For example, if a company operates in both the United States and the European Union, it may choose to store its data in AWS regions located in both regions to ensure compliance with the different data privacy laws and regulations of each region.

# What are the benefits of Edge Locations?

Edge Locations are AWS infrastructure points of presence located around the world and designed to provide low latency and high-bandwidth access to content and services distributed across AWS regions. 

These locations can be used to cache and deliver frequently accessed content to reduce latency for end-users.

Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that delivers static and dynamic web content, including videos, applications, and APIs, from AWS Edge Locations worldwide. 

By using CloudFront, customers can provide low-latency and high-speed delivery of their content to users across the globe.

AWS Global Accelerator is a service that leverages the AWS global network to route traffic to the optimal AWS endpoint. 

It uses anycast routing to route traffic over the AWS global network to the optimal location based on network conditions. 

AWS Global Accelerator can improve availability and performance of applications by directing traffic to healthy endpoints in multiple AWS regions, which can reduce the impact of network-related disruptions on application availability.

In summary, Edge Locations, CloudFront, and AWS Global Accelerator provide benefits such as improved latency, faster content delivery, higher performance, and improved availability of applications and content across the globe.
