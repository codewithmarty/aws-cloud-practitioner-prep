## Where can you find pricing information on AWS services?

There are several places where you can find pricing information on AWS services, including:

- **AWS Simple Monthly Calculator**: This is a web-based tool that allows you to estimate the cost of AWS services based on your usage. It includes a wide range of services, and you can customize the calculator to match your specific requirements.

- **AWS Pricing API**: This is a programmatic way to access AWS pricing data, which can be integrated into your own applications or tools.

In addition to these options, you can also find pricing information in the AWS documentation, AWS blog posts, and other online resources.

## Are there alarms or alerts I can set up to detect changes in cost patterns?

In AWS, you can set up alarms/alerts to help you monitor your billing and pricing. These alarms can notify you when your usage or costs reach certain thresholds. There are a few different ways you can set up alarms/alerts:

- **AWS Budgets**: AWS Budgets allows you to set custom cost and usage budgets for your account. You can receive alerts when you exceed or are forecasted to exceed your budgeted amount.

- **AWS CloudWatch Alarms**: CloudWatch Alarms can be set up to monitor various metrics related to your AWS resources, including billing metrics. For example, you can set an alarm to notify you when your estimated charges exceed a certain amount.

- **AWS Cost Anomaly Detection**: Cost Anomaly Detection is a feature of AWS Cost Explorer that uses machine learning to identify unusual spending patterns in your account. You can set up alerts to notify you when an anomaly is detected.

By setting up alarms/alerts, you can proactively monitor your usage and costs and take action if necessary to prevent unexpected charges or overages.

## What are tags and how can I use tags to keep track of the spending habits of all of my AWS Resources?

Tags are metadata labels attached to AWS resources (such as EC2 instances, S3 buckets, RDS instances, etc.) to help users categorize and manage them. AWS users can use tags to assign cost allocation attributes to their resources, which can be used to categorize and group resources for cost tracking purposes.

For example, a company might use tags to categorize resources by business unit, project, environment (such as development, test, or production), application, or cost center. AWS users can then use tags to filter their cost and usage reports to view costs by tag, making it easier to allocate costs to specific departments or projects.

By using tags in cost allocation, AWS users can gain greater visibility and control over their costs and usage across their entire AWS infrastructure.
